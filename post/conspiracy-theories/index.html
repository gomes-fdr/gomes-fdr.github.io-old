		<p>I simply love scify stories, and in the last year I have watched a lot of then. But what has taken my attention was the number of conspiracy theories that born or came back with a very powerfull force.</p>
<p>So I decided to make a list of it, let&rsquo;s see then.</p>
<h2 id="1-ancient-astronauts">1. Ancient astronauts</h2>
<p>When I was young, I readed a book, it is name was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_the_Gods%3F">Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past</a> by <em>Erich Anton Paul von Däniken</em>. I confess that my head exploded, because it was a great idea, the gods come from space and we are a product made by its hands, very powerful idea.</p>
<h2 id="2-reptilian">2. Reptilian</h2>
<p>They say that it is a very old, but I heard about that recently. In this theory, the most important persons that rule the world was replaced by alien creatures that under the human skin are lizards(or things like that).</p>
<h2 id="3-invisible-hand">3. Invisible hand</h2>
<p>That is a sofisticated sample, because it mixed with historical facts. In a breaf, we have a very powerfull <em>kings</em> that rule the globe, until I know this is tottally truth, but the trick - what bring some misteriou is that <em>people</em> are living in the shadowns and no one knows they.</p>
<h2 id="4-time-travellers">4. Time travellers</h2>
<p>The title talks! We have people that come from future and they do things, I don&rsquo;t know if are good or not.</p>
<h2 id="5-medicine-x-cause-disease-y">5. Medicine [x] cause disease [y]</h2>
<p>And finally, we have the idea that some big pharma that rule the market of medicine(even whole countries) - create some medicine that kill or mutilate us.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-think">What I think&hellip;</h2>
<ol>
<li>I like the idea of aliens, really do - and I have afraid to get by them, but I don&rsquo;t think that they really care about us.</li>
<li>Same to item 1 - the lizards don&rsquo;t want to eat us - by the way I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morena_Baccarin">Morena Baccarin</a>.</li>
<li>This is happen all the time, since we were living in top of the trees - but human beings are very vain to stay in the shadows, trust me.</li>
<li>It will be wonderful if in some point of time we discover that, congrats for us.</li>
<li>That is it very ugly thing to think about us. The time travelers will not allow that its happened. unless the reptilians are in the way.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have a lot of things to learn and ideas like that five listed above, stopped being funny a long time ago.</p>
<p>Be safe.</p>
