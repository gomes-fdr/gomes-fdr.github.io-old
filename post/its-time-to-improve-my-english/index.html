		<p>So, the time come out. In fact I am a bit late about that, english it is a very important tool that a software worker must handle with ability.
Everyday I need to read, write or do some type of content in English. All the content that concern of my day job is done using the Shakespeare tongue.</p>
<p>In the latest years I have thinking about how do I can learning English in the effective way?</p>
<p>How can I do communicate my self in the proper way?</p>
<p>There is many ways to achieve that, so I made a simple list with some goals that I should do it.</p>
<h2 id="read-only-english-content">Read only English content</h2>
<p>I have been doing that for at least 10 years or more, and I guess I did a good read comprehension, mainly technical readings. I try some times to read a book in original format, but it shows very hard to me. I guess it is time to re-try that!
I have at least two  awesome books, scify books that I want to read:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first book of Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin</li>
<li>The red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="write-content-in-english">Write content in English</h2>
<p>When I start do write this bLog, I decided to do that because I have no habit to write. Even in my mother tongue, Brazilian Portuguese. So I decided to start with a simple as possible, posts about tech stuff and my daily routine.
Today I come to my 32o. post and I think it is time to start to write in english, to facilitate the way that I am doing that, I write the content strict in english in the google translator interface. Then I can see if my thoughts are expressed in the right way and I will getting used to put my ideas in plain english.</p>
<h2 id="speak-with-native-speakers">Speak with native speakers</h2>
<p>I do love the to watch great english speakers, interviews and events with audience. Things like products release, speeches or even shows, but today I have no opportunities to speak with no one in english.</p>
<p>I plan to fix that with particular classes, the main candidate is the service called cambly(I don&rsquo;t win a penny by them, yet).
Well it will be a big project and will get I lot of effort and time too, but I know that great things happen if you believe and go get it!</p>
