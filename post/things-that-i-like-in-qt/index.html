		<p>I have been work along this year with Qt framework and there are a lot of things that I really liked, here we going in another list of things that make Qt a great C++ framework to work.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>Well Qt is a super set of C++ it yours main goal is provide a GUI cross platform kit. I think this was the primary idea of the creators of Qt, today I prefer to believe that it is a whole tool to create solutions for a multi environments, since desktops apps, services and CLI tools in a vast different kinds of OSs.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>We have a lot of good strategies designs in Qt, but the documentations is one the strongest thing in this project. Using your code&rsquo;s editor or through the web, we always have full access to complete information, rich of examples e well written explanations.</p>
<h2 id="great-standard-library">Great standard library</h2>
<p>Qt isn&rsquo;t a new program language, even so it provide a great collection of facilities to turn C++ more pleasure, take a look this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modules
<ul>
<li>Qt Core</li>
<li>Qt GUI</li>
<li>Qt Widgets</li>
<li>Qt QML</li>
<li>Qt Quick</li>
<li>Qt Networks</li>
<li>Qt Multimedia</li>
<li>Qt SQL</li>
<li>Qt Webengine</li>
<li>Qt Test</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are a lot of addons, that compose a full collection of solutions that make the developer life more easy.</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-c-standard-library">Integration with C++ standard library</h2>
<p>C++ has been in evolution in the last decades and Qt always try to use what the original language have provide, some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of auto pointers and the replace of foreach as a MACRO.</li>
<li>Replacement the qmake build system for cmake - this is new in Qt6.</li>
<li>Support to lambda functions, direct inheritance from C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that this list is much bigger, but that are things that impact me in the first time that I saw those.</p>
<h2 id="ide-integrated-development-environment">IDE Integrated development environment</h2>
<p>Qt has a tool to write code, it is qt-creator and it is a very good tool, has auto-complete, git integration, GUI builder, debugger and much more things.</p>
<p>I used to use qt-creator to code in C, because of your excellent workflow a robustness.</p>
<h2 id="companies-that-use-qt">Companies that use Qt</h2>
<p>So, all this things and a lot of that I even don&rsquo;t know, make the adoption of Qt almost a natural choice to develop robust apps, that is the reason why some companies adopt it:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD</li>
<li>Blizzard Entertainment</li>
<li>BMW</li>
<li>European Space Agency</li>
<li>Dreamworks</li>
<li>GE</li>
<li>Huawei</li>
<li>John Deere</li>
<li>LG</li>
<li>LucasFilm</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Panasonic</li>
<li>Phillips</li>
<li>Bosh</li>
<li>Samsung</li>
<li>Siemens</li>
<li>Tesla</li>
<li>Volvo</li>
<li>HP</li>
<li>Valve</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a list of companies that I knew - for sure it is much bigger than that!</p>
<p>So, if you are thinking in a tech to learn and like the C family way. It is a great option to be considering with.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies to work with and a great collection of opensource project to colaborate.</p>
